# Building and installing

## Requirements

The tables below are for Linux; [Windows](#windows) and [macOS](#macos) are further down.

### Build

| Need | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Rust toolchain (`rustc`, `cargo`) | 1.96 or newer | compiler (install with [rustup](https://rustup.rs)) |
| C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`) | any | the `ring` crate (TLS for HTTPS streams) compiles C code |
| Internet access | — | `cargo` downloads crates on the first build |

No `-devel`/`-dev` packages and no `pkg-config` are needed. The system
libraries below are loaded at runtime, not linked at build time.

### Runtime

| Library / tool | Required? | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| X11 server or XWayland | **required** | windows (Popamp always uses the X11 backend, including on Wayland desktops) |
| `libasound.so.2` (ALSA) | **required** | audio output; on PipeWire/PulseAudio it goes through their ALSA `default` device |
| `libX11`, `libX11-xcb`, `libxcb`, `libXcursor`, `libXi`, `libxkbcommon`, `libxkbcommon-x11` | **required** | windowing and keyboard (loaded with `dlopen`) |
| `fontconfig` (`fc-match`) and any TrueType font | recommended | playlist and menu text (blank without them) |
| `zenity` or `kdialog` | recommended | open-file, open-URL, save and preset dialogs |
| D-Bus session bus | optional | MPRIS (media keys, desktop widgets) |

### Packages per distribution

Fedora was used for testing. The Debian/Ubuntu and Arch names are the usual
package names but **have not been tested**.

**Fedora**

```sh
sudo dnf install gcc alsa-lib libX11 libX11-xcb libxcb libXcursor libXi \
    libxkbcommon libxkbcommon-x11 fontconfig zenity
```

**Debian / Ubuntu** (untested)

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libasound2t64 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 \
    libxcursor1 libxi6 libxkbcommon0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 fontconfig zenity
```

On Debian 12 and Ubuntu before 24.04 the ALSA package is `libasound2`.

**Arch Linux** (untested)

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel alsa-lib libx11 libxcb libxcursor libxi \
    libxkbcommon libxkbcommon-x11 fontconfig zenity
```

### Windows

Windows 10 or 11, x86_64. The release downloads need nothing else: sound goes
through WASAPI, fonts and dialogs are the system's. Building needs Rust
1.96 or newer with its default MSVC toolchain (rustup offers to install
the Visual Studio Build Tools it needs). So far Popamp runs on Windows in
CI and under Proton; reports from real machines are welcome.

### macOS

macOS 12 or newer, on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs: one disk image holds
both. The macOS version is experimental and
maintained by the community: a release whose macOS build fails ships
without it. The disk images need nothing else:
sound goes through CoreAudio, fonts are found through CoreText, dialogs are
the Mac's own, and Popamp.app carries libopus, libopenmpt and the MIDI
SoundFont. Settings and skins live in `~/Library/Application Support/popamp`.

Until the downloads are signed with a Developer ID, macOS refuses the
first start. Open Popamp once; when macOS says it cannot check it, open
System Settings > Privacy & Security and click Open Anyway (the button is
there for a while after that first try), then confirm. On macOS 12 to 14,
Control-clicking Popamp in Applications and choosing Open also works.
Later starts do not ask.

Building needs Rust 1.96 or newer and the Xcode Command Line Tools
(`xcode-select --install`). To run from the source tree with Opus and
tracker modules, install the libraries with Homebrew first:

```sh
brew install opus libopenmpt
cargo build --release
./target/release/popamp ~/Music
```

To make a disk image for this Mac's kind only:

```sh
sh packaging/macos/fetch-libs.sh dist/libs     # libopus, libopenmpt for macOS 12, the SoundFont
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0 cargo build --release -p popamp
sh packaging/build-macos.sh                    # dist/Popamp-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0 cargo build --release -p popamp --features plus
sh packaging/build-macos.sh                    # dist/Popamp-Plus-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg
```

The releases' universal disk images, for Apple Silicon and Intel, are
built for both targets and joined with `lipo` (add `--features plus` to
the builds for Popamp Plus):

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
ARCH=universal sh packaging/macos/fetch-libs.sh dist/libs
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0
cargo build --release -p popamp --target aarch64-apple-darwin
cargo build --release -p popamp --target x86_64-apple-darwin
lipo -create target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/popamp target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/popamp \
    -output target/popamp-universal
ARCH=universal sh packaging/build-macos.sh target/popamp-universal   # dist/Popamp-<version>-macos-universal.dmg
```

`build-macos.sh` signs ad hoc unless `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY` names a
"Developer ID Application" certificate in the keychain; with
`NOTARY_KEY_PATH`, `NOTARY_KEY_ID` and `NOTARY_ISSUER` (an App Store
Connect API key) it also notarises the disk image. For quick trials,
`packaging/macos/build-dev-app.sh` wraps a build in an ad-hoc-signed
`target/Popamp.app` that Finder can open files with.

## Installation

### Packages

Releases on the [Releases page](https://github.com/popamp/popamp/releases)
come with Linux packages for x86_64 and ARM64 (built on Ubuntu 22.04, so
they need glibc 2.35 or newer) and a Windows installer and portable zip;
Debian and Ubuntu can take the debs from an [apt repository](#debian-and-ubuntu),
openSUSE and Fedora get rpms from a [repository](#opensuse-and-fedora).
All come in two builds:

- **popamp:** the player.
- **popamp-plus:** the player with everything: [plug-ins](plugins.md),
  such as YouTube, and visualizers. It is larger, since it carries a
  WebAssembly runtime and GPU code.

Both install `popamp` and share its settings; installing one replaces
the other.

| System | Package |
|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu | `sudo apt install ./popamp-<version>-linux-amd64.deb`, or `./popamp-plus-…` (ARM64: `-arm64.deb`) |
| Anything else | `Popamp-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage`, or `Popamp-Plus-…`: `chmod +x` it and run it |
| Windows | `Popamp-<version>-windows-x86_64-setup.exe`, or `Popamp-Plus-…`: run it |
| Windows, portable | `Popamp-<version>-windows-x86_64-portable.zip`, or `Popamp-Plus-…`: unpack it anywhere and run `popamp.exe` |
| macOS | `Popamp-<version>-macos-universal.dmg`, or `Popamp-Plus-…`: open it and drag Popamp to Applications |

The installer asks whether to install for you alone or for all users,
adds Popamp to the Start menu, opens `.wsz` and `.psz` skins with it and
puts it in "Open with" for audio files and playlists, and in Settings >
Default apps, where you can make it the player for them (Preferences has
a button that opens that page). Settings and skins
live in `%APPDATA%\popamp` and stay there when Popamp is uninstalled.

On Linux, "Open with Popamp" in Preferences makes it the default player
for audio files, playlists or skins, the way `xdg-mime default` does. An
AppImage or a build of your own gets a desktop entry in
`~/.local/share/applications` for that.

The portable zip has an empty `popamp.ini` next to `popamp.exe`, which
keeps the settings and skins in that folder instead, for a copy on a USB
stick; unpack it where you can write.

`popamp /VERSION` says which one you have.

#### Debian and Ubuntu

Each release puts its debs, for amd64 and arm64, in the apt repository
at apt.popamp.app (built by [popamp/apt](https://github.com/popamp/apt)).
Add it once, and Popamp updates with `apt upgrade`:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/apt/keyrings/popamp.gpg https://apt.popamp.app/popamp.gpg
sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/apt/sources.list.d/popamp.sources https://apt.popamp.app/popamp.sources
sudo apt update
sudo apt install popamp           # or popamp-plus
```

It works on Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 or newer. The repository keeps
only the latest release.

#### openSUSE and Fedora

The [openSUSE Build Service](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/GoodZon:/popamp/) builds rpms of each release for
openSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap 16.0 and Fedora 43 and 44, x86_64 and
ARM64. Add the repository once, and Popamp updates with the rest of the
system:

```sh
# openSUSE Tumbleweed (Leap 16.0: openSUSE_Leap_16.0 instead of openSUSE_Tumbleweed)
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/GoodZon:/popamp/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:GoodZon:popamp.repo
sudo zypper install popamp        # or popamp-plus

# Fedora 44 (or Fedora_43)
sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/GoodZon:/popamp/Fedora_44/home:GoodZon:popamp.repo
sudo dnf install popamp           # or popamp-plus
```

The first install asks you to trust the repository's signing key.

The skins and plug-ins with a release are in both repositories too, as
`popamp-skin-<name>` and `popamp-plugin-<id>` (e.g. `popamp-skin-steel`,
`popamp-plugin-youtube`); a plug-in needs popamp-plus.

The AppImage uses the system's ALSA, X11 and xkbcommon libraries, which
nearly every desktop has. To build the packages yourself after
`cargo build --release` (or with `--features plus` for popamp-plus;
the scripts ask the binary which it is):

```sh
packaging/build-deb.sh        # needs dpkg-deb and binutils
packaging/build-appimage.sh   # needs appimagetool
```

Both write to `dist/`. Or build from source:

### 1. Get Rust (if you don't have it)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### 2. Build and run from the source tree

```sh
git clone https://github.com/popamp/popamp.git && cd popamp
cargo build --release
./target/release/popamp ~/Music
```

The first build downloads and compiles all crates (a few minutes). The
binary is `target/release/popamp`.

This builds the player and its skins. For plug-ins (see
[plugins.md](plugins.md)), build with the `plugins` feature;
it adds a WebAssembly runtime, so the build takes longer and the binary
is larger:

```sh
cargo build --release --features plugins
```

Visualizer plug-ins draw with their own shaders on the GPU, through wgpu
(Vulkan on Linux, Direct3D 12 on Windows, Metal on macOS). They are a separate choice and
turn plug-ins on as well; without this feature the program has no GPU code:

```sh
cargo build --release --features visualizers
```

`--features plus` is everything, and is what popamp-plus is built with.
Only such a build calls itself Popamp Plus.

### 3. Install for the current user (optional)

```sh
packaging/install.sh
```

This builds a release binary and installs:

| File | Destination |
|---|---|
| `popamp` binary | `~/.local/bin/popamp` |
| Desktop entry | `~/.local/share/applications/popamp.desktop` |
| `.wsz`/`.psz` MIME types | `~/.local/share/mime/packages/popamp-skin.xml` |
| Icons (SVG + 16–256 px PNG) | `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/popamp.*` |
| Skins folder | `~/.local/share/popamp/skins/` (created empty) |

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is on your `PATH`. For a system-wide install, run
`sudo PREFIX=/usr/local packaging/install.sh`.

### Uninstall

```sh
rm -f ~/.local/bin/popamp ~/.local/share/applications/popamp.desktop \
      ~/.local/share/mime/packages/popamp-skin.xml \
      ~/.local/share/metainfo/popamp.metainfo.xml
rm -f ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/popamp.png \
      ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/popamp.svg
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
# Settings and skins, if you want them gone too:
rm -rf ~/.config/popamp ~/.local/share/popamp
```
