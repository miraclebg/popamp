# Usage

## Keys and mouse

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Open files | `L`, the eject button, or drag files onto a window |
| Open a URL / stream / YouTube link | `Ctrl+L`, or `popamp <url>` |
| Transport | `Z X C V B` (prev, play, pause, stop, next) |
| Seek / volume | arrow keys, or drag the bars; mouse wheel changes volume |
| Main menu | click the top-left button, right-click, or `Alt+F` |
| Skins | `Alt+S`, or put `.wsz`/`.psz` files in the skins folder (below) |
| Equalizer keys | `1`–`0` / `Q`–`P` raise/lower bands, `N` on/off, `S` presets |
| Tags and cover / album art | `Alt+3` (File info) / `Alt+A` |
| Double size / shade | `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+W` (or double-click the title bar) |

On a Mac, ⌘ does what Ctrl does above and Ctrl+click is a right click;
the menus show each shortcut as it is on the Mac. Where macOS or Mac habits
already use a key, it moves (the table in `apps/popamp/src/mac_keys.rs`
is the one the program and its menus follow):

| Action | Linux, Windows | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Quit | `Alt+F4` | `⌘Q` |
| Preferences | `Ctrl+P` | `⌘,` |
| Close window / minimize | none | `⌘W` / `⌘M` |
| Shade | `Ctrl+W` | `⇧⌘W` |
| Cycle Popamp's windows | `Ctrl+Tab` | ``⌘` `` |
| Always on top | `Ctrl+A` | `⌥⌘A` (`⌘A` selects all in the playlist) |
| File info / invert selection | `Alt+3` / `Ctrl+I` | `⌘I` / `⇧⌘I` |
| Sort by title, file name, path | `Ctrl+Shift+1`/`2`/`3` | `⌥⌘1`/`2`/`3` |
| Stop after current | `Ctrl+V` | `⌥⌘V` |
| Paste links or files into the playlist | none | `⌘V` |
| Remove / crop / clear / remove missing | `Del` / `Ctrl+Del` / `Ctrl+Shift+Del` / `Alt+Del` | `⌫` / `⌘⌫` / `⇧⌘⌫` / `⌥⌫` |
| Top / bottom of the playlist | `Home` / `End` | also `⌘↑` / `⌘↓` |

## Remote control

The same program sends commands to the running instance (`popamp.exe` on
Windows):

```sh
popamp /ADD song.flac      # enqueue
popamp /PLAYPAUSE
popamp /VOL=40 /SHUFFLE=1
popamp /STATUS             # JSON status
popamp /NEW                # start a second, independent instance
popamp /HELP               # all options
```

## Folders

| | Linux | Windows | macOS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Settings, playlist, bookmarks | `~/.config/popamp/` | `%APPDATA%\popamp\` | `~/Library/Application Support/popamp/` |
| Skins, plug-ins | `~/.local/share/popamp/skins/`, `plugins/` | `%APPDATA%\popamp\skins\`, `plugins\` | `~/Library/Application Support/popamp/skins/`, `plugins/` |
| Skins, plug-ins from packages | `/usr/share/popamp/skins/`, `plugins/` (each of `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`) | none | none |

Settings are in `popamp.ini`, whose key names follow `winamp.ini`; the
playlist is saved to `popamp.m3u8`. A `popamp.ini` next to the program
keeps everything in the program's folder (portable mode), and
`/INIDIR=<dir>` uses another folder for one run.

Skins and plug-ins installed as packages (`popamp-skin-<name>` with apt,
zypper or dnf)
are read from the system folders and removed with the package manager.
A skin or plug-in folder of the same name in your own folder wins over
the packaged one. Portable mode and `/INIDIR=` read your folder only.

## YouTube

YouTube is a plug-in, [plugin-youtube](https://github.com/popamp/plugin-youtube),
so it needs a build with plug-ins (`--features plugins`) and the plug-in
installed; its README says how. It plays videos, playlists and channels
through `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`. Without it a YouTube link fails with "no
plug-in plays this link".

The settings `ytdlp_path`, `ffmpeg_path` and `ytdlp_format` of earlier
versions move to the plug-in's settings (`[plugin.youtube]` in
`popamp.ini`) the first time the new version starts.
